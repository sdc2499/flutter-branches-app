# 📍 Branches Management System

A mobile application for displaying and sorting branches based on the user's location. This app retrieves branch data via an API and allows users to view detailed information about nearby branches, making it easy to find the closest one.

### 📝 **Features**:
- **Branch Listing**: The app displays a list of branches with their names and addresses.
- **Location-Based Sorting**: Branches are sorted based on the user's current location using the Geolocator package.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The list updates dynamically, showing the nearest branches based on the user's position.
- **Branch Details**: Each branch has its own detailed page with additional information.

## 🎓 **My Self-Learning Journey**  
This project was built entirely through self-learning. I started from scratch, diving into Flutter development, working with APIs, handling location-based sorting, and integrating real-time updates using the Geolocator package.

This experience not only strengthened my mobile development skills but also improved my ability to work with external data, and I continue to learn and grow with each new feature I implement.
